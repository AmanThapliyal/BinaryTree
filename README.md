# Binary Search Tree Mini Project

This mini project demonstrates the implementation and manipulation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C. It includes functionalities for inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and performing inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of the tree. The project provides a basic interactive console interface for users to build and modify the BST.

## Features

- **Node Insertion**: Insert nodes into the BST based on user input. Nodes are inserted in a manner that maintains the properties of a BST.
- **Node Deletion**: Delete a node from the BST by its value while preserving the BST structure.
- **Tree Traversal**: Perform and display the results of inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
gcc -o bst bst.c
